 2. Better Library Support

    C++ has native support for powerful libraries like:

        OpenCV for image processing.

        ONNX Runtime C++ API for running machine learning models.

        C++ STL (Standard Template Library) â€“ gives vector, string, filesystem, etc.

    These are not available in standard C, or are much harder to use.

 "In C++, you write less code and get more done because of ready-to-use tools."
